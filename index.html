    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a PhD Candidate at the GSEFM Frankfurt, currently visiting the Paris School of Economics. I am also part of the staff at the Chair of International Economics, TU Darmstadt. 
      My research interests lie at the intersection of Political Economy, History and International Trade. In particular, I study the roots and consequences of autocratic and populist transitions by using tools from Institutional Economics, International Trade and Applied Econometrics. 
    Being also deeply interested in debating and international politics, I am a proud member of Liberi Oltre le Illusioni, the only source of news in Italy that is neutral, unbiased and truly evidence-based. </p>
