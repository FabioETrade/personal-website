    <p>
      I am a PhD Candidate at the GSEFM Frankfurt, currently visiting the Paris School of Economics.
      I am also part of the staff at the Chair of International Economics, TU Darmstadt. 
      My research interests lie at the intersection of Political Economy, History and International Trade.
      In particular, I study the roots and consequences of autocratic and populist transitions by using tools 
      from Institutional Economics, International Trade and Applied Econometrics. 
      Being also deeply interested in debating and international politics, I am a proud member of Liberi Oltre le Illusioni,
      the only source of news in Italy that is neutral, unbiased and truly evidence-based.
