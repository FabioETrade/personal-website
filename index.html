    <p>
      I am a PhD Student in Economics at the 
      <a href="https://www.gsefm.eu/about-us.html" target="_blank">GSEFM Frankfurt</a>, 
      specializing in Political Economy, International Economics, and Economic History. 
      I am currently visiting the 
      <a href="https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu" target="_blank">Paris School of Economics</a> 
      and am also part of the staff at the 
      <a href="https://www.vwl2.wi.tu-darmstadt.de/" target="_blank">Chair of International Economics, TU Darmstadt</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      My research interests lie at the intersection of Political Economy, History, and International Trade. 
      In particular, I study the roots and consequences of autocratic and populist transitions using tools 
      from Institutional Economics, International Trade, and Applied Econometrics. My current projects include:
      <ul>
        <li>Exploring the relationship between automation, international trade, and political outcomes in the United States.</li>
        <li>Investigating the role of violent avant-gardes in the transition from democratic to autocratic regimes, in collaboration with Alberto Bisin and Thierry Verdier.</li>
        <li>Analyzing how the Iranian Revolution led to trade diversion and the subsequent economic rise of Türkiye.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to my academic pursuits, I am deeply interested in debating international and italian affairs. 
      I am a proud member of 
      <a href="https://www.liberioltreleillusioni.it/" target="_blank">Liberi Oltre le Illusioni</a>, 
      an italian source of news that is neutral, unbiased, and truly evidence-based. 
      I contribute by writing articles on international economics and politics and interviewing experts in the field of economics and political science.
    </p>
    <p>
      My professional experience includes roles as a Research Associate at Technische Universität Darmstadt, 
      an Economic Affairs Officer at the World Trade Organization, a Research Assistant at ESSEC Business School, 
      and a Graduate Researcher at IGIER, Bocconi University. I hold a Master of Science in Economic and Social Sciences 
      from Università Bocconi, where my thesis focused on "Global Value Chains and Automation: Evidence from the United States."
